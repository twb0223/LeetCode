 You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 Note: You can assume that

 0 <= amount <= 5000
 1 <= coin <= 5000
 the number of coins is less than 500
 the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer
 Example 1:

 Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
 Output: 4
 Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
 5=5
 5=2+2+1
 5=2+1+1+1
 5=1+1+1+1+1
 Example 2:

 Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
 Output: 0
 Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
 Example 3:

 Input: amount = 10, coins = [10]
 Output: 1
